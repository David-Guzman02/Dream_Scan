# Dream_Scan
Active Reconnaissance made simple!

A Capstone project from my time at the Fullstack Academy bootcamp.

We came up with the concept of Dream Scan to show our ability to combine different security tools (Nmap, Searchsploit and Metasploit in this case)
through a python script to guide a beginning user through these tools without needing to know basic commands.
